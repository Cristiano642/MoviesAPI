# MoviesAPI

MovieFinder :: 
A small project where you can search for your movies.

# Describe 

In this project, I created a website that uses an API to search for a movie that is typed by the user. 
An API is an application programming interface that allows communication between different systems. In my case, I used the API of The Open Movie Database (OMDb).
To use the OMDb API, I needed to obtain an access key on the website.
The result was a simple but functional website that allows the user to search for movies and see the name, the poster and the year of each one.
The user can also click on any movie to see more information from IMDB, such as the synopsis, the cast, the director, the genre, the duration and the rating.

# How to use

Just type a movie you're looking for in the search bar.
