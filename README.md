# MoviesAPI

A small project where you can search for your movies

# Describe 

In this project, I created a website that uses an API to search for a movie that is typed by the user. 
An API is an application programming interface that allows communication between different systems. In my case, I used the API of The Open Movie Database (OMDb).
To use the OMDb API, I needed to obtain an access key on the website.
The result was a simple but functional website that allows the user to search for movies and see the name, the poster and the year of each one.
